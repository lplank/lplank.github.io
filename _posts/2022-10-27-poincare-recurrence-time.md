From wikipedia:
> The Poincaré recurrence theorem states that certain dynamical systems will, after a sufficiently long but finite time, return to a state arbitrarily close to (for continuous state systems), or exactly the same as (for discrete state systems), their initial state.
>
> The Poincaré recurrence time is the length of time elapsed until the recurrence. This time may vary greatly depending on the exact initial state and required degree of closeness.

Cellular automata are clearly discrete system. We can measure the Poincaré recurrence (PR) time in terms of steps (we can consider 1 step equivalent to 1 unit of time). It's enough to check if at any given step we enter in a state already seen. It's necessary to store each state seen (an entry in a dictionary) and check for evaluation.

It could be interesting to see poincare recurrence for each rule. Let's calculate the PR for each rule, with size in $[1...K]$ and a maximum number of step N and see what kind of trend we get for each rule.


```python
import time

colorize = np.vectorize(lambda x: 'red' if x == -1 else 'green')
execution_time = []
try:
    step_limit = 20000
    for r in range(0, 256):
        plt.clf()
        print(f'rule {r}')
        start = time.time()
        xs, ub, steps = plot_recurrence_upperbound(r, 50, step_limit=step_limit)
        end =  time.time()
        execution_time.append((end-start, r))
        print("\t", end - start)
        #plt.rcParams["figure.figsize"]=10,10
        #plt.plot(xs, ub)
        #plt.scatter(xs, steps, marker='.', c=colorize(steps))
        #plt.show()
        #plt.savefig(f"rule-{r}_{step_limit}steps.png")
except Exception as e:
    print("aborted", e)

execution_time.sort(reverse=True)
for e in execution_time[:20]:
    print(f"rule{e[1]} took {e[0]}")
```

    <Figure size 640x480 with 0 Axes>



```python
time_only = [x[0] for x in execution_time]
plt.hist(time_only)
plt.title("histogram")
plt.show()
```



{% include figure.html path="assets/img/posts/prt_files/poincare-recurrence-time_11_0.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}



For the great majority of rules the PRT is almost constant up to size 50, so let's just investigate the rules for which $$PRT > 20$$. Those would be
- rule75
- rule89
- rule45
- rule101
- rule149
- rule135
- rule30
- rule86
- rule169
- rule225
- rule195

Let's plot them


```python
width = 100
fig, axes = plt.subplots(5, 2, figsize=(width, 2.5*width))
rules = [75, 89, 45, 101, 149, 135, 30, 86, 169, 225, 195]
for ax, rule in zip(axes.flat, rules):
    x, _ = generate(rule, size=3*width, steps=3*width)
    ax.set_axis_off()
    ax.imshow(x, interpolation='none', cmap=plt.cm.binary)
    ax.set_title(f"{rule} - {bin(rule)}", fontdict = {'fontsize':70})
```

Interestingly enough each pair can be considered as a single rule as the rules in each pair are simmetrical. While the first 8 rules have a similar behavior, showing a clear pattern, the last two rules are very different from the other. Let's run them for a while and see if there is a pattern there.


```python
#rule60 took 8.85617208480835
#rule195 took 8.831139087677002
#rule102 took 8.81187391281128
#rule153 took 8.585221767425537
